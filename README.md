## Welcome to Navi

Navi is a non-binary tree with different quantities of nodes.

Projects separates into two parts:

1) core: library with Tree implementation
2) app: application  does serialization/deserialization tree from file and prints results in console with saved structure

## Command line options
1) Read and print input file:
```
./naviApp -i inputFileName
```
2) Read and print input file to outputFile
```
./naviApp -i inputFileName -o outputFileName
```
3) Print tree filled by test data and write it to file
```
./naviApp -o outputFileName
```
